      <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
The Fares project is a crowdsourced investigation developed by Aaron Gordon and Dhruv Mehrotra of Jalopnik to increase transparency surrounding Uber and Lyft pricing practices. The ridehail companies say drivers are independent contractors, but do not allow them to set their own prices, nor can they decline unprofitable rides without facing potential reprimand from the company. Uber and Lyft unilaterally determine pricing structures. Yet, the ridehail companies retain total control over the data regarding how rider fares are divided between the driver and the company and have routinely declined to share it. This project is an attempt to shed light on how fares are split. <a href="https://jalopnik.com/we-think-uber-and-lyfts-new-surge-fares-screw-drivers-a-1835952856">You can read more about our reporting on this topic here.</a> If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or feedback, you may email agordon+fares@jalopnik.com or contact us securely via WhatsApp and Signal.

   <h2>Data Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Jalopnik is using a third party service called Typeform to handle the design and processing of this form - you can read about their data privacy and security practices <a href="https://admin.typeform.com/to/dwk6gt/">here</a>. Jalopnik will permanently delete all data from the Typeform database. Once deleted from Typeform,  we will not under any circumstance disclose individual data you provide to us with any third party. Jalopnik will, however, share insights gleaned from the data in aggregate in future articles. We round all fare amounts to the nearest dollar to better anonymize each transaction.  While both Jalopnik and Typeform have taken precautions to ensure the safety and security of your data, we cannot guarantee that Uber will not take retaliatory action for submitting to Jalopnik.
