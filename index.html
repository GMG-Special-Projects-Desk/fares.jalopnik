 		One is a legend of rally racing, a fearsome and dominant machine piloted by some of the greatest drivers of its time, a car that would redefine the kind of performance we expect from a four-cylinder motor. The other is... well, pretty much the exact same, except with a boxer engine. They formed a rivalry that sadly no longer exists today, but its legend certainly does. In the war between the Subaru WRX/STI and the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, who ya got?(Welcome to Who Ya Got, a new series where you get to vote on famed car rivalries, some more notable than others.)Our Craigslist-scouring friend Graverobber is on a much-deserved vacation this week, and Nice Price or Crack Pipe will return when he does.But since we keep you, the reader, first in our lives, we cooked up this new feature to give you something to vote on in the morning when you should be sifting through your work inbox to decide which emails from your boss you’re going to ignore today. (If you work at Jalopnik, the answer is “all of them.”)Even as car culture has become more inclusive with big-tent events like Radwood proving way more fun than the old meets where most of the cars look and feel the same, it’s still very fun to argue which car is “best.” And if you got into Japanese cars in the 1990s and early 2000s, as I did, the battle between the WRX and the Evo was an exciting and colorful part of the automotive landscape.
